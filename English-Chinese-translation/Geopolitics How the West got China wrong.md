LAST weekend China stepped from autocracy into dictatorship. That was when Xi Jinping, already the world’s most powerful man, let it be known that he will change China’s constitution so that he can rule as president for as long as he chooses—and conceivably for life. Not since Mao Zedong has a Chinese leader wielded so much power so openly. This is not just a big change for China (see article), but also strong evidence that the West’s 25-year bet on China has failed.

上周，中国由专制走向独裁。这是当习近平——已经是世界上最有权力的人——明确表示他将修改中国宪法，使得他能够按照自己的意愿统治国家，而且可以想象得到是终身制的。自毛泽东成为中国的领导人公开拥有如此大的权力以来，从来没有过的。这不仅对于中国是个巨大的改变，而且也是西方在过去25年来对中国下注失败的有力证据。

After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the West welcomed the next big communist country into the global economic order. Western leaders believed that giving China a stake in institutions such as the World Trade Organisation (WTO) would bind it into the rules-based system set up after the second world war (see Briefing). They hoped that economic integration would encourage China to evolve into a market economy and that, as they grew wealthier, its people would come to yearn for democratic freedoms, rights and the rule of law.

在前苏联解体后，西方欢迎下一个共产主义大国进行全球经济秩序中。西方领导人相信，让中国在诸如世界贸易组织（WTO）的体系中占有一席之地能够将其与二战后建立的基于规则的系统捆绑起来。他们希望经济一体化能鼓励中国发展市场经济以及，当中国人变得更富裕，他们会向往民主自由，人权和法台。


It was a worthy vision, which this newspaper shared, and better than shutting China out. China has grown rich beyond anybody’s imagining. Under the leadership of Hu Jintao, you could still picture the bet paying off. When Mr Xi took power five years ago China was rife with speculation that he would move towards constitutional rule. Today the illusion has been shattered. In reality, Mr Xi has steered politics and economics towards repression, state control and confrontation.

这是一个有价值的愿景，用报纸分享这个理念也比把中国关在门外好。中国人的致富超出了任何人的想象。在胡锦涛的领导下，你依然能够想象赌注能回本。当习近平五年前掌权后，中国便充斥着猜测他将会领导国家走向宪政的说法。如今，幻想破灭了。事实上，习近平把政治和经济转向了镇压，国家操控和冲突。

All hail, Xi Dada
万岁，习大大

Start with politics. Mr Xi has used his power to reassert the dominance of the Communist Party and of his own position within it. As part of a campaign against corruption, he has purged potential rivals. He has executed a sweeping reorganisation of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), partly to ensure its loyalty to the party, and to him personally. He has imprisoned free-thinking lawyers and stamped out criticism of the party and the government in the media and online. Though people’s personal lives remain relatively free, he is creating a surveillance state to monitor discontent and deviance.

最初从政治开始。习近平重申中共的统治地位以及他在其中的位置。作为反腐运动的一部分，他清除了一些潜在的竞争对手。他对人民解放军（PLA）进行了重组，部分原因是确保对党以及对他本人的忠诚。他将一些拥有自由思想的律师送入监狱，把对党和政府在媒体和网络上的批评者进行禁言。尽管人民的个人生活相对自由，他建立了一个监控王国对异常行为进行监督。

China used to profess no interest in how other countries run themselves, so long as it was left alone. Increasingly, however, it holds its authoritarian system up as a rival to liberal democracy. At the party’s 19th congress last autumn, Mr Xi offered “a new option for other countries” that would involve “Chinese wisdom and a Chinese approach to solving the problems facing mankind.” Mr Xi later said that China would not export its model, but you sense that America now has not just an economic rival, but an ideological one, too.

中国曾公开表示对其它国家如何运作没有兴趣，只要不干涉到它。然而，它把越来越多的威权体制作为自由民主的对手。在去年秋天的十九大会议上，习近平提出“给其它国家一个新的选择”，就是“用中国人的智慧和方法解决人类面临的问题“。习近平最后说，中国不会输出模式，但你可以感觉到，美国现在不仅面对的是一个经济对手，还是一个意识形态的对手。

The bet to embed markets has been more successful. China has been integrated into the global economy. It is the world’s biggest exporter, with over 13% of the total. It is enterprising and resourceful, and home to 12 of the world’s 100 most valuable listed companies. It has created extraordinary prosperity, for itself and those who have done business with it.

嵌入市场的赌注更成功。中国已经融入全球经济。这是世界上最大的出口国，占总数超过13%。这是一个有进取心和有谋略的国家，其中全球100家最有价值的上市公司中就有12家。它创造了非凡的财富，为自己以及那些和它做买卖的人。

Yet China is not a market economy and, on its present course, never will be. Instead, it increasingly controls business as an arm of state power. It sees a vast range of industries as strategic. Its “Made in China 2025” plan, for instance, sets out to use subsidies and protection to create world leaders in ten industries, including aviation, tech and energy, which together cover nearly 40% of its manufacturing. Although China has become less blatant about industrial espionage, Western companies still complain of state-sponsored raids on their intellectual property. 

然而中国并不是市场经济，并且，就目前的状态来说，永远都不会是。相反，作为国家权力的一部分越来越多地控制商业活动。它视各行各业作为战略目标。比如，其“中国制造2025“计划，它会使用国家补贴和保护措施在十个行业内创造世界领头人，包括航空，科技和能源行业，而这些覆盖了将近40%的制造业。尽管中国在工业间谍方面已经不那么明显，但西方国家的公司依然抱怨有国家资助的公司对其知识产权的掠夺。

Meanwhile, foreign businesses are profitable but miserable, because commerce always seems to be on China’s terms. American credit-card firms, for example, were let in only after payments had shifted to mobile phones.

同时，外资企业虽是盈利但却苦不堪言，因为生意似乎看起来要按照中国的条款来运作。比如，美国信用卡公司，只有支付手段要转移到手机端才能进入中国市场。

China embraces some Western rules, but also seems to be drafting a parallel system of its own. Take the Belt and Road Initiative, which promises to invest over $1tn in markets abroad, ultimately dwarfing the Marshall plan. This is partly a scheme to develop China’s troubled west, but it also creates a Chinese-funded web of influence that includes pretty much any country willing to sign up. The initiative asks countries to accept Chinese-based dispute-resolution. Should today’s Western norms frustrate Chinese ambition, this mechanism could become an alternative.

中国也接受西方的一些规则，但似乎也在准备自己的另一套与之相应的系统。以“一带一路”而言，承诺在国外市场投资超过1万亿美元，最终使马歇尔计划相形见拙。这不仅是发展中国困境中的西部地区计划的一部分，而且也创造中国投资的影响力网络，包括很多愿意签约的国家。该倡议要求各国接受基于中国的争议调解方案。当下西方的规则如果挫败中国人的野心，这个机制可能会成为另一个选择。

And China uses business to confront its enemies. It seeks to punish firms directly, as when Mercedes-Benz, a German carmaker, was recently obliged to issue a grovelling apology after unthinkingly quoting the Dalai Lama online. It also punishes them for the behaviour of their governments. When the Philippines contested China’s claim to Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea, China suddenly stopped buying its bananas, supposedly for health reasons. As China’s economic clout grows, so could this sort of pressure.

同时中国用买卖来摆平它的对手。它直接寻求一些受惩罚的公司，如奔驰公司，一家德国汽车制造公司，不久前不得不卑躬屈膝地道歉，在不假思索地在网上引用达赖喇嘛的句子之后。同时也会惩罚它们的政府行为。当菲律宾对中国关于南海的斯卡伯勒浅滩提出异议时，据说出于健康原因，中国突然停止购买该国的香蕉。随着中国经济实力的增强，这种压力也会同时增加。

This “sharp power” in commerce is a complement to the hard power of armed force. Here, China behaves as a regional superpower bent on driving America out of East Asia. As with Scarborough Shoal, China has seized and built on a number of reefs and islets. The pace of Chinese military modernisation and investment is raising doubts about America’s long-run commitment to retain its dominance in the region. The PLA still could not defeat America in a fight, but power is about resolve as well as strength. Even as China’s challenge has become overt, America has been unwilling or unable to stop it.

在商业中“尖锐力量”也是军队硬实力的补充。在这方面，中国表现得像一个区域大国，下决心把美国赶出东亚。正如斯卡伯勒浅滩一样，中国占领并且建造了一些珊瑚礁和岛屿。中国军队现代化和投资的步伐使得美国的长期承诺和保持在该地区主导地位承诺正受到质疑。中国解放军现在还不能在战争中击败美国，但是权力关乎决心和力量。正如中国公开进行挑战，美国不愿也无法阻止。

Take a deep breath深呼吸

What to do? The West has lost its bet on China, just when its own democracies are suffering a crisis of confidence. President Donald Trump saw the Chinese threat early but he conceives of it chiefly in terms of the bilateral trade deficit, which is not in itself a threat. A trade war would undermine the very norms he should be protecting and harm America’s allies just when they need unity in the face of Chinese bullying. And, however much Mr Trump protests, his promise to “Make America Great Again” smacks of a retreat into unilateralism that can only strengthen China’s hand.

怎么办？西方对中国的赌注已经输了，正当它们本国的民主正遭受信心危机的时候。特朗普政府早前已经看到中国的威胁，但他认为是双边贸易逆差造成的，并不是它自身的威胁。贸易战将会破坏他应该保护的准则以及会伤害美国的盟友，当他们面对中国的欺凌时，应该团结一致。同时，无论特朗普如何抗议，他所承诺的“美国优先”有一种把美国退回到单边主义的意味，而这将会加强中国的优势。

Instead Mr Trump needs to recast the range of China policy. China and the West will have to learn to live with their differences. Putting up with misbehaviour today in the hope that engagement will make China better tomorrow does not make sense. The longer the West grudgingly accommodates China’s abuses, the more dangerous it will be to challenge them later. In every sphere, therefore, policy needs to be harder edged, even as the West cleaves to the values it claims are universal.

相反，特朗普需要重塑中国政策的实施范围。中国和西方国家不得不学习求同存异。在今天容忍这种不当行为以期望这种约定会把中国在明天变得更好是没有意义的。当西方越是不情愿地容忍中国的恶习时，这种危险就越有可能在不久挑战它们。因此在每一个领域，政策需要更加强硬，当西方宣称其所奉行的价值观是普世价值时。


To counter China’s sharp power, Western societies should seek to shed light on links between independent foundations, even student groups, and the Chinese state. To counter China’s misuse of economic power, the West should scrutinise investments by state-owned companies and, with sensitive technologies, by Chinese companies of any kind. It should bolster institutions that defend the order it is trying to preserve. For months America has blocked the appointment of officials at the WTO. Mr Trump should demonstrate his commitment to America’s allies by reconsidering membership of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, as he has hinted. To counter China’s hard power, America needs to invest in new weapons systems and, most of all, ensure that it draws closer to its allies—who, witnessing China’s resolve, will naturally look to America.

为了抗衡中国强大的力量，西方社会应该阐明独立基金会之间的联系，哪怕是学生团队和中国政府。为了抗衡中国经济力量的滥用，西方国家应该监督国有企业的投资以及中国任何类型公司参与的敏感技术。西方国家应该去保护这个体系，这个体系是捍卫了一直以来努力去保护的规则。数月来，美国已经阻止了世贸组织官员的任命。特朗普应该对美国盟友的承诺，重新考虑加入跨太平洋伙伴关系协定，因为他已经暗示了。为了抗衡中国的硬实力，美国需要投资新的武器系统，以及，最重要的是，确保向其目睹中国决心的盟友靠拢，他们自然会将目光投向美国。

Rivalry between the reigning and rising superpowers need not lead to war. But Mr Xi’s thirst for power has raised the chance of devastating instability. He may one day try to claim glory by retaking Taiwan. And recall that China first limited the term of its leaders so that it would never again have to live through the chaos and crimes of Mao’s one-man rule. A powerful, yet fragile, dictatorship is not where the West’s China bet was supposed to lead. But that is where it has ended up.

正在崛起的大国间的竞争对手不必挑起战争。但是习近平渴望权力增加了毁灭性不稳定的机会。他有一天也许会因收复台湾而觉得荣耀。回想中国首次限制领导人的任期时，它将永远不会再经历毛泽东独裁统治的混乱和犯罪。一个强大的，脆弱的专制并不是西方对中国下的赌注所应该领导的。但这就是它已经结束的地方。
