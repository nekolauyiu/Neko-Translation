HONG KONG

IT WAS a remarkable climbdown in the face of mass protests. Just three days after suggesting that to retreat would be like spoiling a child, Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, announced the indefinite shelving of a proposed law that would allow the extradition of criminal suspects to mainland China. Mrs Lam now says she wants to avoid “chaos” in Hong Kong. Her U-turn came after the bill had provoked the biggest demonstration in many years, and another protest that escalated into the most violent social unrest in decades.

在面对大型游行示威中，政府作出了妥协。香港特首林郑月娥形容撤回送中条例就像溺爱孩子，而仅在三天后，便宣布无限期搁置嫌疑犯引渡到中国大陆的议案。而林郑现在则声称为了避免香港“混乱”而撤回议案。由于法案激发了多年来最大型的游行，以及游行升级为过去几十年间最为激烈的社会动荡后，林郑率领的香港政府的态度发生了大转变。

Few had expected the government to make such a concession, let alone so soon. The government had earlier planned to get the bill adopted by the Legislative Council by the middle of July, when the body is due to begin its summer break. It had described getting the law passed as “urgent”. But on June 15th Mrs Lam told reporters that the government would suspend the proceedings and would not set a deadline for resuming them.

鲜有人预料政府会这么快做出让步，更别说在这么短的时间内了。政府早前希望立法会七月中旬暑期休假时通过该条例。立法会将该法案描述为“紧急”状态。但是6月15日林郑告诉记者，政府决定暂缓该议案，对重启议案不设时间期限。

It appears that public pressure has succeeded—for now, at least—in making the government reconsider a policy that had strong backing from the Communist Party in Beijing. Protests have not always proved so successful. In 2003 the government shelved a controversial anti-subversion bill after hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets. But in 2014 protesters occupied streets in busy commercial areas for 79 days to push for democratic reform and secured no concessions. Since then many observers thought leaders in Hong Kong and Beijing had become even less inclined to give way to public opinion on sensitive political matters.

这证明了公众的舆论压力是成功的——至少目前是这样的——使得香港政府认为政策获得了北京共产党的支持。在2003年政府在数以千计的市民示威后暂缓了反颠覆罪的条例。但在2014年示威者为了推动民主改革和保障，占领了繁忙街道79天后，政府没有作出让步。自那以来，观察人士认为，香港和北京当局在敏感政治事务上变得更不愿意向民意屈服。

On this occasion, however, opposition has involved far more than the usual critics of the party’s policies in Hong Kong. Businesspeople, lawyers and foreign governments have expressed considerable anxiety about the legislation. Although the proposed bill would allow extraditions to more than 170 other jurisdictions, the protests have focused on the potential for people in Hong Kong, including foreigners there, to be sent to mainland China, where courts are explicitly under the Communist Party’s control and dissidents are jailed on trumped-up criminal charges.

然而这次，在香港的反对派的声音远比平时对建制派政策批评的声音多得多。商界人士、律师以及外国政府都对立法机构表示也极度担忧。尽管草拟中的法案允许向170多个司法管辖区进行引渡，示威者认为在香港的公民包括外国人会被送返到中国大陆，而大陆的法庭由中国共产党掌握，持不同政见者会因为莫须有的罪名而入狱。

Opponents of the bill have been organising what they hope will be another large demonstration in Hong Kong on June 16th. They say it will go ahead despite Mrs Lam’s announcement, in order to push for the complete scrapping of the bill and to protest against what they say was the excessive use of force by the police during the outbreak of violence on June 12th. Amid reports of suspected protesters being sought among the scores of wounded in hospital, some also want Ms Lam to guarantee that there will be no prosecutions. It is telling that Mrs Lam has not retracted her claim that the unrest had been “a riot”.

反对条例人士希望在6月16日组织另一场大规模游行示威。他们声称，不管林郑宣布暂缓该条例，依然会上街，为了能够彻底撤回条例以及抗议警方在6月12日的冲突中滥用武力。由于条例的暂缓，在行动中受伤住院的示威者也希望林郑能保证他们不会被起诉。据称林郑不会收回由骚乱改为“暴动”的声明。


Hong Kong’s government had argued that the main reason for introducing the bill now was to enable a suspect to be sent to face trial in Taiwan, where he is alleged to have murdered his girlfriend. The man is currently in prison in Hong Kong for a money-laundering offence and is due to be released in October. The bill would remove a provision in Hong Kong’s current law that excludes extraditions to “other parts of China”, which in Hong Kong means the mainland, as well as Macau and Taiwan. But Mrs Lam noted that Taiwan has said it will not accept the suspect’s extradition under the new law. She said that since the bill would not solve that one case, it was no longer urgent to pass it.

香港政府就引入该条例发生过争论，主要原因是能够让一名犯罪嫌疑人能够送往台湾受审，他被指控杀害其女友。该名男子现在以洗钱罪关在香港监狱，预计10月被释放。该条例将从香港现有的法律中被删除，包括不引渡到“中国的其它地方”，对香港来说就是大陆，同时还有澳门和台湾。但林郑指出，台湾在新的法律框架下不接受逃犯引渡条例。她表示，由于该法案不能解决这个案件，所以暂缓通过该法案的审议。

On June 12th Liu Xiaoming, China’s ambassador to Britain, told the BBC that the government in Beijing had nothing to do with initiating the bill. At her press conference, Mrs Lam said the central authorities had supported both her efforts to introduce the bill and her decision to shelve it. But there has been widespread speculation that the central leadership has been far more actively involved. Mrs Lam owes her position to a committee of local residents that is deliberately stacked with sympathisers of the Communist Party’s policies in the territory. She would be highly unlikely to make any move on such an important matter without seeking the party’s blessing. She declined to comment on local reports that she met one of China’s most senior politicians, Han Zheng, in the Chinese border city of Shenzhen on June 14th.

6月12日，中国驻英国大使刘晓明告诉BBC，北京没有让香港修例。在她的新闻发布会上，林郑表示中央政府对其提出法案和决定搁置都表示支持。但是有普遍言论怀疑，中央领导层积极参与其中。林郑的职位归功于一些由当地居民组成的委员会，委员会是共产党政策在香港的坚定拥挤者。在这样一个重要的事情上，如果得不到共产党的支持，她是很难开展工作的。她对本地传媒关于6月14日在深圳边境与中国高层官员韩正见面一事不予置评。

The U-turn is a humiliation for Beijing, which has sought to tighten its grip on Hong Kong. But at least it is one the Communist Party can pin on Ms Lam rather have the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, portrayed in poor light. Even within the limits imposed by the Communist Party, Hong Kong enjoys a degree of free expression and political flexibility, which is more than can be said for mainland China.


Mrs Lam, for her part, deflected reporters’ repeated questions about whether she would heed the demands of protesters that she resign. There would be a precedent for doing so. Tung Chee-hwa, who was chief executive when the anti-subversion law was shelved, stepped down a few months later, apparently because of his handling of that bill. Mrs Lam said the central government had shown her “understanding, trust, respect and support”. To keep her job, she will need more such backing.
