IN THE past few weeks, large-scale protests in Hong Kong have become almost routine. But they have largely avoided direct challenges to the Communist Party in Beijing. Another massive one on July 21st, involving hundreds of thousands of people mostly clad in black, initially followed the typical pattern. Participants marched peacefully through central Hong Kong, chanting slogans denouncing a recently shelved law that would have allowed criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China. But this time there was a difference. At the end of it, thousands kept marching to the central government‘s headquarters in the city. The party is clearly enraged.

在过去的数周，香港的大型示威已经几乎成为一种常规。但是他们最大程序上避免直接挑战在北京的中国共产党。另一场大型的示威发生在7月21日，成千上百的人群依照惯例穿上黑衣。参与者们和平游行经过香港的中环，高呼口号谴责最近搁置的法律，这条法律允许犯罪嫌疑人被引渡回中国大陆。但是这次有所不同。最后，成千上万的示威者不断前往城市中的中央政府总部。中国共产党显然被激怒了。

Remarkably, there was no sign of police outside the harbour-front building on the west side of Hong Kong island when the demonstrators arrived after dark. As word spread that police were preparing to deploy in the area, the protesters soon moved back towards the central business district. In one location police fired tear gas and rubber bullets, but groups of protesters, many wearing goggles and gas-masks, remained scattered across a wide area. Some erected barricades and wrote slogans on walls.

值得注意的是，当示威者在天黑后到达时，在港岛区西侧的海滨广场外并无警察的身影。有传言称，警察将在这一区进行部署。在某一个位置，警察发射了催泪弹和橡胶子弹，但是仍有几群示威者，戴着护目镜和防毒面具，分散在广阔的区域内。一些人建起了一些路障和在墙上涂写了一些标语。

The slogans left on the central government‘s building, in large black characters, included “Down with the Chinese Communist Party,” and “f—k Zhina”—Zhina being a derogatory way of referring to China because it was the word that was used by Japan during its occupation of swathes of the country in the 1930s and 1940s. Paint was also spattered on the central government’s emblem at the front entrance.

在中联办的建筑物上，示威者们用黑色的大字写上了标语，包括“中国共产党下台”以及“该死的支那“——支那是一种贬低中国的说法，因为这个词过去曾被在30和40年代曾占领过中国的日本使用过。油漆溅洒在入门处中央政府的徽章上。


Central-government officials were quick to respond. A statement on the office‘s website said the slogans “insulted the country and its people” and accused the demonstrators of going “well beyond the scope of peaceful protest”. It said they had “seriously challenged the central government’s authority” as well as tested the “bottom line” of what China calls the “one country, two systems” arrangement under which it has ruled Hong Kong since Britain handed the territory back in 1997.

中央政府马上作出回应。官方网站的声明表示，标语“辱骂国家和人民”以及指责示威者“远远超出和平示威的范围”。据称，他们“严重挑战中央政府的权威”，并考验中国称为“一国两制”制度的底线，这个制度是自1997年自英国归还香港后一直实行管理香港的方案。


This is not the first time that the party in Beijing has been alarmed by the behaviour of some protesters. After another large demonstration on July 1st, the anniversary of the handover in 1997, a smaller group smashed their way into the Legislative Council building and briefly occupied the chamber. Clashes between protesters and police have erupted in towns near the border with the mainland.

这不是在北京的政党第一次被一些示威者的行为感到震惊。在7月1日——1997年回归纪念日——的另一场大规模示威后，一小群人闯进了立法会大楼，短暂占据议会厅。示威者和警察在靠近中国边界的地方暴发了冲突。(译者注：指7月21日在元朗发生了白衣人持杀伤性工具无差别殴打途人的恶性事件，也被香港传媒和国际社会称为“警黑勾结”的制造社会恐慌的恐怖袭击。)


Some of the anti-government protesters had argued, however, that demonstrating outside central-government offices in Hong Kong would be pointless and possibly counter-productive. They fear it would anger the party and stiffen its resolve to tighten control in the territory. Better, they said, to keep up pressure on the local government to scrap the extradition law entirely and launch an independent investigation into police violence against protesters. Tactics, however, appeared to shift at the protest on July 21st—a sign, perhaps, of demonstrators‘ frustration with what they see as the Hong Kong government’s failure to offer satisfactory responses to their demands.


一些反政府的示威者曾经讨论，无论如何，在中联办做过激行为并无意义并且有可能达不到预期的目标。他们害怕会惹怒共产党以及加紧对香港的强硬管治。好消息是，他们声称，保持对本地政府的压力以及启动关于警察暴力对于示示威者的独立调查。（译者注：香港政府根本无意于启地独立调查委员会关于警方滥用暴力的情况。）。然后，策略在7月21日似乎发生了转变——也许是一个信号——示威者们的一个失败就是他们认为香港政府未能就他们的要求作出满意的回应。


Some want the chief executive, Carrie Lam, to step down. She has indicated that she plans to stay on. And the party does not appear willing to sacrifice her—at least not yet. The central government office‘s statement expressed “resolute support” for the Hong Kong government and its police force in their efforts to protect social stability. The local authorities also criticised the protesters for straying beyond the permitted route for the march and for challenging the central government. On July 20th groups in Hong Kong sympathetic to the party held their own rally calling for calm; organisers said more than 300,000 people took part.

一些人希望林郑月娥下台。她曾说，她计划留任。共产党似乎不打算牺牲她——至少目前是这样。中央政府办公室的声明表达了“坚定支持”香港政府以及警察机构在保护社会稳定所做的努力。本地当局也批评示威者在偏离允许的路线上游行以及挑战中央政府。在7月20日，一群香港的亲中人士举行自己的集会，呼吁示威者冷静；组织者称，超过30万人参与。

Temperatures are running high. At one station on Hong Kong‘s mass-transit railway, people wearing the black shirts favoured by protesters were attacked by stick-wielding men in white shirts as they emerged from their train on their way home from the latest protest. More than forty people were injured, one critically. Pro-democracy activists said they suspected triads (organised criminal gangs) were behind the violence and accused police of being slow to respond. Hong Kong’s stability is being challenged as never before since the British departure.
气温正逐渐攀升。在香港的一个地铁站，人们穿着喜爱的黑色T-恤，他们是示威者最后撤退的一部分，正打算坐地铁回家，被一群白衣人挥舞着藤条袭击。超过四名人士受伤，其中一名重伤。亲民主派活动家表示，他们怀疑三合会（一个黑帮犯罪组织）在后面操纵暴力行为以及，指责警方反应迟缓。香港的稳定，自英国撤离后正日渐受到挑战。
