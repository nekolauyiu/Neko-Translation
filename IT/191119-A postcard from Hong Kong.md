To a visitor from messy Mumbai, on the surface Hong Kong seems, despite months of anti-government protests, in order. Busy shops, clean streets, trains that run on time—or at all. clp, the 118-year-old electric utility, has just moved from its old headquarters in Kowloon to a new one over a shopping mall (inevitably). Both digs are (inevitably) to be redeveloped. Business as usual, then?

对于来自脏乱的孟买的游客来说，香港表面上看起来是有序的，尽管经历了数月的反政府示威。繁忙的商店、干净的街道、地铁准点，所有一切都是有序的。香港中国照明与动力公司（简称CLP），这个有着118年历史的电力设施，从九龙的旧总部不得不搬到一个购物商场的楼上。这两个地方都需要重新开发，那么，商业能照常运作吗？


Not quite. Two French bakeries that popped up after your correspondent left in 2011, to ride Hong Kong’s surge as Europe flailed, have shut. The owners felt the tide had turned. A recent graduate from Canada, who grew up in the territory, notes how hard it is to get a job. Hong Kong is in recession (see chart). Hiring has slowed, particularly by confused multinationals. People, he says, are leaving. Millennials with work offers elsewhere are not returning. It is, many reckon, worse than the sars epidemic in 2003. Back then Hong Kongers were united. Now they seem deeply divided. Arguments flare up far from the riots.

情况不完全是这样。在本报记者于2011年离开香港后，有两间法国面包店——当欧洲经济衰退的时候搭乘了香港经济的顺风车——结业了。老板感觉风向变了。一名在本地长大，最近从加拿大毕业的学生，留意到了就业困难。香港正陷入衰退中（如图所示）。减缓招聘，特别是一些认为时下局势不明朗的跨国公司。他说，很多人正离开香港。千禧代在别处找到了工作也不再回来。许多人认为这次比2003年的沙士还要糟糕。那个时候香港人很团结。现在看来他们相互之间有着很深的分歧。争论在骚乱未开始的时候已经发生了。

A bartender in Wanchai, a busy commercial district, says business is slow. Watering holes lose money (except during events that draw out the fearless, such as televised matches during the recent Rugby World Cup). Protests, or the expectation of them, can scotch anything involving crowds—cultural dos, parties—that once evinced Hong Kong’s vitality. People stay at home. Cops in riot-gear guard mtr stations. The public-transport company’s share price is down by 18% since July.

在繁华的商业区，一名湾仔的酒保表示，生意很差。酒巴亏钱（除了在一些吸引勇者的赛事中，比如最近的橄榄球世界杯的电视转播比赛）。示威者或者他们的诉求，都能破坏一切和群众文化有关的事情，如文化活动、聚会，而这些曾经是香港活力的象征。自7月以来，公司运输公司的股票价格下跌了18%。


The upheaval appears to have narrowed Hong Kong’s intellectual bandwidth, too. A decade ago business and finance types would talk about all of Asia. Now they speak of little besides Hong Kong and mainland China. This is not wholly irrational. At one investment bank half of equity trading still involves American shares, but one-third is now China—more than Japan, South Korea, Australia, Taiwan and India combined.

这场剧变也引发了香港精英阶层收窄所涉行业的范围。二十年前，商人和金融人谈论的是整个亚洲市场，现在他们只谈论香港和中国大陆，其它地区很少被提及。这是完全不合理的。在一家投资银行内，一半以上的股票交易依然是美股，但现在三分之一是中国，远超日本、南韩、澳洲、台湾以及印度的总和。


A Hong Kong tycoon of Indian descent says that if he were young, he might move back to his ancestral land. His children are now at the age (early 30s) when in years past the Sassoons, an Asian trading dynasty, would dispatch them to entrepots to advance the family concern. They are choosing to stay put—because India, the obvious destination, has disappointed too much. Hong Kong’s disappointments have not made it unlivable. The Hang Seng stockmarket index swooned over the summer, but has since recovered some of the decline. Hope of a return to normal lingers on. For now.

一名印度裔香港大亨表示，如果他现在很年轻，他也许会回到他的国家。他的孩子在这个年龄（约30出头）里，在过去几年，作为一个亚洲贸易王朝——沙逊家族——他们被派到各个贸易中心，以提高家族的声誉。他们选择留在了香港，显而易见，目的地印度让这个家族太失望。而对香港的失望并没有让这座城市变成不适合居住的地方。恒生指数在整个夏天显得萎靡不振，但此后也反弹了些许。现在，仍有希望恢复正常的社会秩序。
