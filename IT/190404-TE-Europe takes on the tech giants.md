Europe takes on the tech giants  
欧洲制裁科技巨头  
To understand the future of Silicon Valley, cross the Atlantic  
大西洋另一头，硅谷的未来  

“The birthday of a new world is at hand.”Eversince Thomas Paine penned those words in 1776, America has seen itself as the land of the new—and Europe as a continent stuck in the past. Nowhere is that truer than in the tech industry. America is home to 15 of the world’s 20 most valuable tech firms; Europe has one. Silicon Valley is where the brainiest ideas meet the smartest money. America is also where the debate rages loudly over how to tame the tech giants, so that they act in the public interest. Tech tycoons face roastings by Congress for their firms’ privacy lapses. Elizabeth Warren, a senator who is running for president in 2020, wants Facebook to be broken up.

"新世界的诞生就在眼前。"自1776年托马斯·潘恩(Thomas Paine)写下了这句话以来，美国一直把自视为新大陆，并且把欧洲看作守旧的大陆。这一点在科技领域尤为突出。世界20家最具价值科技公司有15家在美国，而欧洲只有一家。在硅谷，世界上最聪明的想法与最明智的投资汇聚在一起。但同时，美国也在激烈争论如何驯服这些科技巨头，以便让他们的行为符合公众利益。科技巨头们为他们自身存在隐私漏洞遭到国会痛批。竞选2020总统的参议员伊丽莎白·沃伦(Elizabeth Warren)希望拆分Facebook。

Yet if you want to understand where the world’s most powerful industry is heading, look not to Washington and California, but to Brussels and Berlin. In an inversion of the rule of thumb, while America dithers the European Union is acting. This week Google was fined $1.7bn for strangling competition in the advertising market. Europe could soon pass new digital copyright laws. Spotify has complained to the eu about Apple’s alleged antitrust abuses. And, as our briefing explains, the eu is pioneering a distinct tech doctrine that aims to give individuals control over their own information and the profits from it, and to prise open tech firms to competition. If the doctrine works, it could benefit millions of users, boost the economy and constrain tech giants that have gathered immense power without a commensurate sense of responsibility.

不过如果你想要了解全球最有影响力的科技行业的发展方向，那么目光不能局限于华盛顿和加利福尼亚，而要关注布鲁塞尔和柏林。让人大跌眼镜的是当美国还在犹豫不决的时候欧洲已经开始行动起来了。本周，谷歌因广告市场恶意竞争而被罚款17亿美元。欧盟很快将通过新的数字版权法案。Spotify向欧盟投诉苹果涉嫌滥用反垄断法。正如我们的报道所说，欧盟正在率先推行旨在保护个人隐私信息和收益权的新规则，并鼓励科技公司参与竞争。如果这些新规则能够起效，它将可以让数百万用户受益，刺激经济增长，并约束那些没有相应责任感、却聚集了巨大力量的科技巨头。

Western regulators have had showdowns ver antitrust with tech firms before, including ibm in the 1960s and Microsoft in the 1990s. But
today’s giants are accused not just of capturing huge rents and stifling competition, but also of worse sins, such as destabilising democracy(through misinformation) and abusing individual rights (by invading privacy). As ai takes off, demand for information is exploding, making data a new and valuable resource. Yet vital questions remain: who controls the data? How should the profits be distributed? The only thing almost every-one can agree on is that the person deciding cannot be Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s scandal-swamped boss.

西方监管机构此前对科技公司就反垄断问题进行过摊牌，包括20世纪60年代的IBM和90年代的微软。但是今天的巨头们不仅被指责攫取巨额费用和抑制竞争，还被指责犯下更严重的罪行，比如破坏民主稳定(舆论误导)和滥用个人权利(侵犯隐私)。随着人工智能落地，信息需求正在爆炸式增长，这使得数据成为一个新的有价值的资源。然而，关键的问题依然存在：谁来控制数据？利润如何分配？唯一可以肯定的事情是所有人都同意这个人不是Facebook丑闻缠身的马克扎克伯克(Mark Zuckerberg).

The idea of the eu taking the lead on these questions will seem bizarre to many executives who view it as an entrepreneurial wasteland and the spiritual home of bureaucracy. In fact, Europe has clout and new ideas. The big five tech giants, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft, make on average a quarter of their sales there. And as the world’s biggest economic bloc, the eu’s standards are often copied in the emerging world.
Europe’s experience of dictatorship makes it vigilant about privacy. Its regulators are less captured by lobbying than America’s and its courts have a more up-to-date view of the economy. Europe’s lack of tech firms helps it take a more objective stance.

欧盟在这些问题上起了带头作用的观点对很多高管而言很荒唐，他们将欧盟视为创业荒地和官僚主义精神家园。然而事实上，欧洲有着巨大影响力和新的想法。Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook和Microsoft这五大科技巨头平均有四分之一的业绩来自于此。同时作为世界上最大的经济体，欧盟的标准经常被新兴国家复制。
欧洲的独裁历史使得他们对于隐私十分敏感。与美国相比，它的监管制度更少受到游说影响，它的法院对于经济看法更贴近现状。欧洲技术公司的缺乏使得其能采取更客观的立场。

A key part of Europe’s approach is deciding what not to do. For now it has dismissed the option of capping tech firms’ profits and regulating them like utilities, which would make them stodgy, permanent monopolies. It has also rejected break-ups: thanks to network effects, one of the Facebabies or Googlettes might simply become dominant again. Instead the eu’s doctrine marries two approaches. One draws on its members’ cultures, which, for all their differences, tend to protect individual privacy. The other uses the eu’s legal powers to boost competition.

欧洲所采取的策略的一个关键部分是决定不该做什么。目前，欧盟已经放弃了限制科技公司利润并像公用事业公司那样监管它们的选择，这将使它们成为顽固的、永久的垄断企业。同时也拒绝和这些公司分手。在互联网效应下，下一个Facebook或者Google可能很容易又占据主导地位。相反，欧盟策略融合了两种方法。一种是利用其成员的文化，尽管他们之间存在差异，但这种文化往往会保护个人隐私。另一个则利用欧盟的法律手段来促进竞争。

The first leads to the assertion that you have sovereignty over data about you: you should have the right to access them, amend them and determine who can use them. This is the essence of the General Data Protection Regulation (gdpr), whose principles are already being copied by many countries across the world. The next step is to allow interoperability between services, so that users can easily switch between providers, shifting to firms that offer better financial terms or treat customers more ethically.(Imagine if you could move all your friends and posts to Acebook, a firm with higher privacy standards than Facebook and which gave you a cut of its advertising revenues.) One model is a scheme in Britain called Open Banking, which lets bank customers share their data on their spending habits, regular payments and so on with other providers. A new report for Britain’s government says that tech firms must open up in the same way.

第一条原则是你对你自己数据有绝对的所有权：你有权访问，修改并授权给他人使用。这就是《通用数据保护条例》(GDPR)的核心，其准则已被世界上很多国家效仿。进一步是允许服务间的互通性，以便用户可以容易的在服务提供商之间切换，转向有更好财务条款或者道德规范的公司。(想象一下你可以讲你所有的朋友和帖子转移到一家隐私标准比Facebook更高，并且将会分享一部分广告收入给你的Acebook.) 其中有一种模式是一项在英国名为“开放银行”的计划，该计划允许银行客户与其他银行分享他们的消费习惯、定期付款等数据。英国政府的一份新报告称，科技公司必须遵循同样的开放模式。

Europe’s second principle is that firms cannot lock out competition. That means equal treatment for rivals who use their platforms. The eu has blocked Google from competing unfairly with shopping sites that appear in its search results or with rival browsers that use its Android operating system. A German proposal says that a dominant firm must share bulk, anonymised data with competitors, so that the economy can function properly instead of being ruled by a few data-hoarding giants.(For example, all transport firms should have access to Uber’s information about traffic patterns.) Germany has changed its laws to stop tech giants buying up scores of startups that might one day pose a threat.

欧盟的第二条原则是公司不能垄断竞争。这意味着对于使用它们平台的竞争对手也要一视同仁。欧盟已经禁止Google利用其搜索结果中出现的购物网站或使用其Android操作系统的竞争对手的浏览器进行不公平竞争。德国一项提议称占主导地位的公司必须同竞争对手大量共享匿名数据，以便促使经济正常运作，而不是被少数公司垄断。(例如，所有的运输公司都应该可以访问Uber的交通模式信息.) 德国已经修改法律阻止科技巨头收购那些有潜在威胁的创业公司。

Europe’s approach offers a new vision, in which consumers control their privacy and how their data are monetised. Their ability to switch creates competition that should boost choice and raise standards. The result should be an economy in which consumers are king and information and power are dispersed. It would be less cosy for the tech giants. They might have to offer a slice of their profits (the big five made $150bn last year) to their users, invest more or lose market share.

欧盟的方案描绘了一幅新的愿景，即消费者们能够控制他们的隐私和数据被货币化。他们的转换能够创造新的竞争，促使新的选择和更高的标准。创造出一个顾客至上，信息和权力分散的经济体。当然，这对科技巨头而言将不会那么舒适。他们将不得不让利一部分给他们的客户(去年五大巨头利润大约为1500亿美元)，投入更多或者失去部分市场.

The European approach has risks. It may prove hard to achieve true interoperability between firms. So far, gdpr has proved clunky. The open flow of data should not cut across the concern for privacy. Here Europe’s bureaucrats will have to rely on entrepreneurs, many of them American, to come up with answers. The other big risk is that Europe’s approach is not adopted elsewhere, and the continent becomes a tech Galapagos, cut off from the mainstream. But the big firms will be loth to split their businesses into two continental silos. And there are signs that America is turning more European on tech: California has adopted a law that is similar to gdpr. Europe is edging towards cracking the big-tech puzzle in a way that empowers consumers, not the state or secretive monopolies. If it finds the answer, Americans should not hesitate to copy it—even if that means looking to the lands their ancestors left behind. 

欧盟的方法也存在着一定的风险。让公司之间实现真正的互通可能是很难的。到目前为止，GDPR已经被证实十分笨重。开放的数据流不应该涉及到隐私的关注。在这一点上，欧洲的官僚们将不得不依赖企业家们(其中很多是美国人)去寻找答案。另一个巨大的风险是欧盟的方法并没有被其他地区采纳，好比是科技世界里的加拉帕戈斯群岛(Galapagos)，与主流世界隔绝。但是大公司并不愿意将他们的业务拆分成两个分离的孤岛。而且有迹象表明，美国在科技领域正在向欧洲靠拢: 加州已经通过了一项类似于GDPR的法律。欧洲正试图以一种赋予消费者权力的方式解决大的科技难题，而不是国家或秘密垄断。如果找到了答案，美国人应该会毫不犹豫的复制它——即使这意味着他们回望着他们的先辈当年决绝离开的土地。
