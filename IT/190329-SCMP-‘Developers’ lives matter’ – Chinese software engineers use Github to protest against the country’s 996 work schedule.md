##### “开发者的命也是命”—— 程序员使用Github抗议中国的996工作制度
- 该项目发布之后得到了开发者们广泛支持，收到了超过30,000个点赞。
- CB Insights研究发现，在101家新创公司失败案例中，其中有8%的原因是由员工疲倦引起的。

Resentment against long working hours in China’s tech industry is growing among software developers that use the Github open development platform after a user posted a copy of China’s labour laws on the site and named two e-commerce companies that practice the 996 work schedule – 9am to 9pm, six days a week.

使用Github的软件开发人员对中国科技公司长时间工作日益不满，其中一名开发人员发布了一份中国劳动法并点名两家电子商务公司实行996 ———早九点到晚九点，每周工作 6 天。

A Github user called “996icu” posted a so-called repo (repository) on Tuesday complaining that working 996 all the time means running the risk of ending up in the “intensive care unit”, adding that “developers’ lives matter”, a reference to the US activist movement Black Lives Matter.

Github用户“996icu”在周二发布了一个仓库，抱怨一直996工作意味着冒着被送进“重症监护室”的风险，并补充说，“开发者的命也是命”，引用了美国维权运动的口号“黑人的命也是命”。（BLM: Black Lives Matter是一项国际活动家运动，起源于非裔美国人社区，旨在反对针对黑人的暴力和系统性种族主义。 BLM定期举行抗议活动，反对警察杀害黑人，以及更广泛的问题，如种族貌相，警察暴行和美国刑事司法系统中的种族不平等；以上来源维基百科。译者注）

By Thursday night, the Github post had more than 30,000 “stars”, a metric that allows users to bookmark a project they like. 996icu was also ranked No 1 on the site’s trending page on Thursday.

截止周四晚，Github上该帖子已有超过30,000个“星”(这是一个允许用户标记他们喜欢项目的一个标志)。同时，996icu也在该站热门榜上位居第一。

The post also named Chinese e-commerce firms Youzan and JD.com as practising 996, and highlighted a comment from Youzan chief executive Bai Ya, responding to the company’s adoption of 996 since the Chinese New Year.

该帖子还指出了两家中国电子商务公司——有赞和京东正在实施996工作制。并标注了有赞CEO白鸦自春节以来对996工作制的回应。

“This would definitely be a good decision when we look back in a few years time,” Bai said in a post on his own WeChat Moments page at the time. When news of Youzan’s adoption of 996 went viral, it triggered an inspection by the labour authorities in Hangzhou, where the company is based.

“几年后回头看，这次绝对是好事。”白鸦在他个人微信朋友圈里回应。当有赞推行996制的消息在网上疯传后，引发了有赞总部所在地杭州市劳动局的介入调查。

“After our investigation, we found that [Youzan] hasn’t practised a 996 work schedule,” the Hangzhou Xihu Labor Inspection Brigade said in a faxed statement to the South China Morning Post on Thursday.
A JD.com spokesman said on Thursday: “We believe in hard work and that being ‘all in’ leads to the fruit of success, but are also advocating for a healthy and effective approach to work.”

杭州西湖劳动监察大队在周四发给《南华早报》的一份传真声明中表示，“经过调查，并未发现有赞公司实行996工作制” 。

一位京东发言人也在周四发表声明：“我们相信努力工作，‘全情投入’将会带来成功，但我们也提倡健康高效的工作方式”。

Tech firms in China typically expect their employees to work long hours to prove their dedication. However, some young Chinese tech workers are coming to the realisation that they need to strike a better work-life balance for the sake of their own health.
Beijing-based ByteDance, which runs the popular short video app TikTok, has eased that a bit by introducing a “big/small week” policy, where most of its employees work a six-day week every second week.

中国科技公司通常希望自己的员工长时间工作来证明自己的奉献精神。然而，一些年轻的中国科技工作者开始意识到，为了自己的健康，他们需要更好的平衡工作和生活。
总部位于北京的字节跳动（ByteDance）公司运营了最火的短视频APP抖音（TikTok）推出“大/小周”略微缓解了这一情况。该公司大多数员工每隔一周工作六天。

“Serving a company that encourages the 996 work schedule usually means work for at least 60 hours a week,” 996.icu wrote on Github and on a separate 996. ICU website that was registered on March 18. “According to the Labor Law, employees who follow the 996 work schedule deserve to be paid 2.275 times of their base salary. Unfortunately, people who work under 996 rarely get paid that much.”

“为一家推行996工作制的公司服务意味着每周至少工作60小时.” 996.icu 在Github和另一个注册于3月18日的"996.ICU"的网站上发布了信息：“根据《劳动法》相关规定，按照996工作制的员工应该获得基本工资的2.275倍。不幸的是，大部分996工作制下的员工几乎能拿不到到那么多工资”。

A full copy of the Chinese Labor Law, which prohibits more than 36 hours of overtime per month,  was attached to the post.
Microsoft’s Github is an online version control platform usually used by programmers and engineers to share codes and collaborate on projects.

《中华人民共和国劳动法》禁止每月加班超过36小时，微软的Github是一个程序员和工程师共享代码及合作项目的在线版本控制平台。

“I suggest we gathera list of the companies that are practising 996 and the ones are not,” user Yaunping-Huang commented on Github, which is also used by some Chinese users to discuss various topics, including social issues.
Another user called TheFirstWhiteDream wrote, “We should raise our legal awareness like foreigners!”
“I’m jealous of all of you, because I work as 896,” user HelloAnyu said.

“我建议我们应该搜集一份实行或没有实行996工作制的公司名单”，用户Yaunping-Huang在Github上评论道。一些中国用户也用在上面讨论各种话题，包括一些社会问题。
另一位名为TheFirstWhiteDream的用户也写道：“我们应该像外国人一样提高法律意识！”

“我嫉妒你们所有人，因为我的工作是896”用户 HelloAnyu如此说道。

The public discussion about the negative impact of the 996 work culture is going beyond Github.
On WeChat, China’s dominant social media platform, a developer surnamed Li posted on Moments, “Life or money, it’s a question. But you can’t get both at the same time.”

关于996工作文化负面影响的讨论已经不止局限于Github。在中国占主导地位的社交媒体平台微信上，一位李姓的开发者在朋友圈上发帖称:“生命还是金钱，这是个问题。但你不太可能同时兼得两者。”
