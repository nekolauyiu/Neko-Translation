A new kind of cold war
Trade has long anchored the relationship between China and America, but it is no longer enough. 
The world should be worried, says David Rennie


Since china emerged from the wreckage of Maoism 40 years ago, the profit motive has become a pillar of stability in its relations with America. Presidential candidates might accuse China of
stealing jobs. Spy scandals could simmer. Then corporate bosses and politicians in Beijing and Washington would decide that all
sides were making too much money to let relations sour. This focus on mutual self-interest involved queasy compromises. Soon
after troops massacred hundreds, possibly thousands, around Tiananmen Square in June1989, President George H.W.Bush wrote discreetly to Deng Xiaoping to urge joint efforts to prevent “tragic recent events” from harming relations. The financial crash of 2008 revealed a dangerous co-dependency between America the importer of cheap goods and China the thrifty exporter. New terms tried to capture this symbiosis: “Chimerica”, or “theg2”.



Suddenly, however, making money is not enough. In the past
couple of years, debate about how to get engagement to work has
given way to talk of strategic competition and security threats.
Rather than catchy neologisms, scholars are reaching for historical analogies. Some talk of 1914,when clashing Britis hand German
ambitions swept aside deep bonds of commerce. China analysts
obsess over the “Thucydides trap” that supposedly dooms upstart
nations to fighting incumbent powers, as the Greek historian
wroteofSpartaandAthens.



China’s rise was always going to cause turbulence. The same

shock of the 1970s and 1980s triggered demands from politicians

Critics argue that elitess hould have seen this coming.Western
leaders had hoped that joining the global economy would make

The crash of 2008 and spasms of Western populism emboldened
Communist Party leaders, notably President Xi Jinping, to reject
Those norms and assert the party’ssupremacy.


America’s shock is made worse by trade in technologies that
blur the lines between commerce and national security. The
Trump administration’s opposition to letting Huawei, a Chinese
technology firm, build 5g telecommunications networks for
America or its allies is a taste of that future. Such debates are, at
root, about trust, a commodity that mattered less when China ex-
ported tennis shoes and televisions rather than microchips that
can keep self-driving cars on the road and planes in the air. Yet
clumsy forms of self-defence cause harm. Define sensitive tech-
nologie stoo broadly and,in the words of Henry Paulson,a former
secretary of the treasury,an“economic iron curtain”may come to
divide China and America,choking flows of goods,capital,people
and technology,with grave implications for therest of the world.


China’s growing tech prowess is putting new strains on global-
isation, beyond old arguments about stolen jobs. The fact that
General Motors sells more cars in China than in America used to
help both countries manage ideological differences. Today’s sup-
ply chains, carrying semiconductors from China to devices in
America, actually raise the political stakes.


Million-dollar American weapons rely on microchips sourced
from firms around the globe. Critical infrastructure may contain
components from a dozen nations, require software updates from
a provider on one continent and send streams of real-time data to
another. In April a Pentagon advisory board warned defence chiefs
to plan for “zero-trust” commercial internet networks. A growing
number of business transactions require a lifetime commitment
to distant service-providers. In this world, trade relations cannot
be quarantined from hard questions about whether countries are
partners, rivals or foes.


China has every right to want to grow stronger. Its success in
helping hundreds of millions of people to raise themselves from
poverty is admirable. It is the relentlessness of its methods that
has turned business from a safe space to a field of contention.
Western firms worry that before China truly opens up, they will be
thrown out—as soon as Chinese firms have learned, bought or sto-
len enough Western knowhow to become self-reliant.


Nothing to lose but your supply chains

Few Americans have better access to Chinese leaders than Mr Paul-
son, a longtime proponent of engagement. So it was noticed when
in February he declared that, because China has been slow to open
its economy since joining the World Trade Organisation in 2001,
“the American business community has turned from advocate to
sceptic and even opponent of past us policies toward China”.
Bosses do not seek a tariff war, he said, but do want a “more con-
frontational approach”. Businesses are getting that from the
Trump administration.


In part, this is explained by the change in occupant of the Oval
Office. President Barack Obama also denounced Chinese trade
cheating and pressed China to stop stealing commercial secrets.
Belatedly, his Pentagon chiefs grew alarmed as China turned dis-
puted reefs in the South China Sea into military outposts. But ulti-
mately Mr Obama put more weight on tackling global challenges,
from climate change to pandemics to nuclear proliferation, for
which he needed Chinese help. Get-tough policies were endlessly
discussed, then often dropped. Mr Trump, by contrast, boasts that
solving the world’s problems is not his job.


In part, America has become more confrontational because
multinational businesses that oppose barriers to trade have lost clout in a populist age. A new round of export controls for sensitive
technologies and still-tougher investment-screening rules loom.
That process will not end with a truce in Mr Trump’s trade war.


The American president is as much a symptom as a cause of a
change in the way that America thinks about its openness to the
world. Voters elected a might-makes-right leader who scorns alli-
ances, who is cynical about the rule of law and universal values
and who believes that national interests always come first. Amid
espionage fears, visa rules for Chinese students of science and
technology have tightened. fbiagents have quizzed scholars visit-
ing from Chinese state-backed think-tanks about government
links, and cancelled the visas of some. Rather than China becom-
ing more Western, America is becoming more Chinese.


Meanwhile, officials in Beijing see a sore loser of a superpower,
bent on keeping them down. They scoff at the idea that rich,
spoiled America really feels threatened, seeing a ploy to extract
better terms for American firms to make money. This misses how
many people in Washington believe that the China threat is real
and matters more than profits or free-market purity. Indeed, offi-
cials accuse firms of keeping quiet when Chinese spies steal intel-
lectual property, to preserve face and access to Chinese markets.


A senior American official says that China “emphatically” lied
when it promised Mr Obama in 2015 that state-backed actors
would stop spying on America for commercial gain. The official la-
ments that, in the frenzied Washington news cycle, few noticed a
Department of Justice indictment in December 2018 accusing Chi-
na’s ministry of state security of ties to a long-standing campaign
by the apt10 hacking group, stealing secrets from firms in aviation,
space, pharmaceuticals, oil and gas, maritime and other technol-
ogies. “They basically got the crown jewels of hundreds and hun-
dreds of the world’s biggest companies,” he says.


The pendulum risks swinging too far. Some sniggered in March
when the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States
(cfius), a government agency that screens foreign deals for securi-
ty concerns, asked a Chinese internet firm to sell Grindr, a gay dat-
ing app with 3.3m daily users. Actually cfius may have a point. A
gay app could be a blackmailer’s trove, and Chinese police routine-
ly grab data from social media at home. It is harder to take seriously
Senate attempts to ban Washington, dc, from using federal money
to buy metro trains made in America by a Chinese state-owned
company lest on-board security cameras are used for spying.


Although China lacks the formal alliances that made the Soviet
Union a global threat, its rise dominates Pentagon debates about
the future of war. Since the 1980s America has pursued a “forward
presence” doctrine, meaning that its forces were confident about
operating close to enemy defences. China’s growing strength con-
fronts Pentagon planners with their hardest decision in years: to
find new ways to make combat in the Western Pacific viable, or pull
back and force adversaries to fight far from home.



Karl Eikenberry was a China expert in the army who became a
lieutenant-general, then ambassador to Afghanistan. Now at Stan-
ford University, he describes commanders grappling with the end
of overwhelming American superiority: “There is an intense debate within the American armed forces about how to counter the
pla’s accelerating efforts to control the South China Sea.”
This report will look at clashing views
in Washington and Beijing about how to
manage the technological, military, economic and political aspects of a great-power contest so new that the two sides do not even agree on what successful relations might look like. Rules must be found. Mr Eikenberry’s summary of the military challenge applies to the whole: “A new doctrine is required.”
