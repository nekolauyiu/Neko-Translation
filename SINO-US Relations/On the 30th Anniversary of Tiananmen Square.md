On the 30th Anniversary of Tiananmen Square

PRESS STATEMENT

MICHAEL R. POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE
 
JUNE 3, 2019

WASHINGTON, DC


On June 4, we honor the heroic protest movement of the Chinese people that ended on June 4, 1989, when the Chinese Communist Party leadership sent tanks into Tiananmen Square to violently repress peaceful demonstrations calling for democracy, human rights, and an end to rampant corruption. The hundreds of thousands of protesters who gathered in Beijing and in other cities around China suffered grievously in pursuit of a better future for their country. The number of dead is still unknown. We express our deep sorrow to the families still grieving their lost loved ones, including the courageous Tiananmen Mothers, who have never stopped seeking accountability, despite great personal risk. The events of thirty years ago still stir our conscience, and the conscience of freedom-loving people around the world.

Over the decades that followed, the United States hoped that China’s integration into the international system would lead to a more open, tolerant society. Those hopes have been dashed. China’s one-party state tolerates no dissent and abuses human rights whenever it serves its interests. Today, Chinese citizens have been subjected to a new wave of abuses, especially in Xinjiang, where the Communist Party leadership is methodically attempting to strangle Uighur culture and stamp out the Islamic faith, including through the detention of more than one million members of Muslim minority groups. Even as the party builds a powerful surveillance state, ordinary Chinese citizens continue to seek to exercise their human rights, organize independent unions, pursue justice through the legal system, and simply express their views, for which many are punished, jailed, and even tortured.

We salute the heroes of the Chinese people who bravely stood up thirty years ago in Tiananmen Square to demand their rights. Their exemplary courage has served as an inspiration to future generations calling for freedom and democracy around the world, beginning with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of communism in Eastern Europe in the months that followed.

We urge the Chinese government to make a full, public accounting of those killed or missing to give comfort to the many victims of this dark chapter of history. Such a step would begin to demonstrate the Communist Party’s willingness to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms. We call on China to release all those held for seeking to exercise these rights and freedoms, halt the use of arbitrary detention, and reverse counterproductive policies that conflate terrorism with religious and political expression. China’s own constitution stipulates that all power belongs to the people. History has shown that nations are stronger when governments are responsive to their citizens, respect the rule of law, and uphold human rights and fundamental freedoms.


在6月4日这一天，我们纪念中国人民英雄般的抗议运动，这场运动止于1989年6月4日，当时，中国共产党领导人向天安门广场派出坦克，以暴力镇压了呼吁民主、人权、结束猖獗腐败的和平示威。聚集在北京和中国其它城市的成千上万的抗议者为追求国家的美好未来而蒙受了惨痛损失。死亡人数仍然未知。我们向那些仍在为失去亲人而悲伤的家庭表示深切的哀悼，这包括勇敢的天安门母亲们。她们冒着巨大的个人风险，永不停息地追究责任。三十年前的事件仍然触动着我们和全世界热爱自由的人民的良知。

在镇压之后的几十年里，美国曾希望中国融入国际体系将迎来一个更加开放和宽容的社会，但那些希望破灭了。中国的一党制政权不容忍任何异议，只要有其利益需要，不论何时都会践踏人权。 今天，中国公民受到新一波的侵权，特别是在新疆，共产党领导层有计划地试图扼杀维吾尔文化，摧毁伊斯兰教信仰，包括拘留100多万穆斯林少数民族人士。 即使共产党建立了强大的监控国家，普通中国公民仍在继续寻求行使他们的人权，组织独立工会，通过法律制度追求正义，或者只是表达自己的观点，但许多人因此遭到惩罚，监禁甚至酷刑。

三十年前，中国人民的英雄们在天安门广场勇敢地站了起来，要求他们的权利，我们向他们致敬。他们的勇气堪称楷模，从柏林墙的倒塌以及随后几个月东欧共产主义的终结开始，一直激励着后人在世界各地争取自由和民主。

我们敦促中国政府全面和公开交代遇难或失踪者的情况，以告慰这一黑暗历史篇章的众多受害者。这一步骤将开始表明共产党愿意尊重人权和基本自由。我们呼吁中国释放所有因争取行使这些权利和自由而被监禁的人，停止使用任意拘押手段，并扭转将恐怖主义与宗教和政治表达混为一谈的适得其反的政策。中国自己的宪法规定，一切权力属于人民。历史表明，当政府顺应民意，尊重法治，维护人权和基本自由时，国家就会更加强大。
